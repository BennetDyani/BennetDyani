<h2>Work Readiness Portfolio</h2>

### Career Counselling
<br>Situation
 I attended a career counselling session hosted by DVT, a leading software development company, where they offered insights into the tech industry, particularly for aspiring Java developers like myself.

<br>Task</br>
My goal during this session was to gain clarity on the Java developer career path, understand industry expectations, and get practical advice on how to position myself for success in the job market.

 <br>Action</br>
During the session, I engaged with mentors and senior developers who shared their personal journeys, discussed real-world Java applications, and broke down what companies look for in junior devs. I asked questions about certification paths, frameworks like Spring Boot, and how to build a standout portfolio.

<br>Result</br>
I walked away with a stronger sense of direction. I realized that Java isn't just a programming language—it's a career path backed by solid demand and community support. I’ve since updated my learning goals to focus more on backend architecture, started building Spring Boot projects, and mapped out a certification plan. The session turned career anxiety into a solid strategy.

[Bennet_Dyani_Report.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20414372/Bennet_Dyani_Report.pdf)

<br>Situation</br>
As part of the work readiness program, I took the Red Bull Wingfinder personality assessment to gain deeper insight into my strengths, working style, and how I operate within team dynamics.

 <br>Task</br>
My goal was to better understand my personal attributes and how they could align with my career path as a developer — especially in collaborative, fast-paced environments.

<br> Action</br>
I completed the full Wingfinder assessment, which measured different traits like creativity, focus, and people skills. I took time to reflect on the results and compared them with how I’ve approached team projects and problem-solving in the past.

<br> Result</br>
The assessment identified my top strengths as:

Innovative – I naturally think outside the box and enjoy tackling problems from new angles.

Diplomatic – I’m able to navigate team dynamics with respect and balance, helping maintain a positive and productive work environment.

Sociable – I connect easily with others, which helps in building strong, communicative dev teams.

Supportive – I’m the kind of team member who lifts others up, celebrates wins, and shares knowledge freely.

These insights reinforced my belief that technical skills get you in the room, but soft skills keep you in the team. I’m now more intentional about applying these traits in projects and using them as a foundation for leadership and collaboration in tech.

<h2> My CV</h2>
<br>Situation</br>
My previous resume was a basic document that only listed a few projects and general academic info. It lacked structure, detail on technical skills, and didn’t clearly communicate my capabilities or unique developer identity.

<br>Task</br>
Redesign my resume to present myself as a competitive candidate for internships and junior developer roles by clearly demonstrating technical ability, real project experience, and a growth-driven mindset.

<br> Action</br>
I restructured the resume with modern best practices in mind:

Professional Summary: Added a clear, compelling summary that positions me as an aspiring developer with strong Java and Android skills.

Core Competencies: Highlighted my technical toolbox — from Java, Spring, and SQL to design patterns and version control — making my skill set scannable and role-ready.

Project Portfolio: Listed actual GitHub project links, each with bullet-point descriptions outlining features and tech stacks.

Experience Section: Added real-world industry experience at Plum Systems to show practical exposure.

Design Enhancements: Used clean sectioning, consistent formatting, and contact links to make it recruiter-friendly and professional.

<br>Result</br>
The new resume paints a complete picture of me as a developer — not just a student. It clearly showcases:

Technical depth with technologies like JPA, Spring, Android, and Git.

Project ownership with real, accessible work via GitHub.

Professional development with hands-on experience and soft skills.
This upgrade increases my credibility, strengthens my job applications, and puts me in a far stronger position for interviews and internship offers.

<h2> CV Submission</h2>
<br> Situation</br>
After creating the first draft of my newly upgraded CV, I realized that while it looked solid to me, I needed outside feedback to make sure it was truly effective, clear, and competitive in the job market.

<br>Task</br>
My objective was to validate the content, structure, and clarity of my resume before submitting it for any opportunities. I wanted to ensure it communicated my value clearly and was free from technical, formatting, or flow issues.

<br>Action</br>
I reached out to a few trusted peers — fellow developers and classmates — and shared my CV with them for peer review. I asked for specific feedback on technical skills representation, project descriptions, grammar, and overall layout. I gathered their suggestions, noted areas of confusion or weakness, and revised the document accordingly.

 <br>Result</br>
The feedback I received helped me refine my project descriptions, better organize my skill sets, and clean up formatting inconsistencies. This review process made my CV more polished, professional, and employer-ready. It also reinforced the importance of collaboration and feedback loops — even in solo tasks like resume writing. Now, I feel confident presenting my CV in any setting, knowing it’s been battle-tested by people who understand the industry.
